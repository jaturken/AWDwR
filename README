This project contains programming exersises from book "Agile Web Development
with Rails", 4th edition. 

Used 3rd-party gems:
- formtastic
- devise
- cancan
- will-paginate
- rspec - not yet
- dragonfly - not yet
- nested_set - not yet
- jrails - not yet
- kaminari - not yet
- meta_search - not yet
- meta_where - not yet

NOTE: as it is seen from screenshots and ways to files, authors separate depot
app into depot_a, depot_b e.t.c. I solve not to separate it and still don't
suffer.
